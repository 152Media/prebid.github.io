# Overview

Pre-bid auctions (also known as "header auctions" or "header bidding")
run directly on a publisher's page and allow publishers to access
external demand that may not be available through their primary ad
server.

Prebid.js is a 100% free and open source Javascript framework designed
to make it easier for publishers to run pre-bid auctions and get
access to more demand with minimal integration hassle.

For more information about how header bidding with Prebid.js works,
see [How it Works]({{site.github.url}}/how-it-works.html).

# Benefits

The benefits of pre-bid auctions include:

- Access to more demand; partners compete on 100% of the publisher's
  inventory.

- Generally higher CPMs and fill rates.

- More transparency about who is purchasing the publisher's inventory
  as a result of eliminating "waterfall" methods and estimated CPMs.

- Reduced discrepancies and pass-backs.

- Lower transaction costs.

The benefits of using Prebid.js in particular are:

- 100% free and open source, giving you complete control over how you
  use it.

- Clean, built-in support for all major bidders as well as major ad
  servers.

- It solves many problems publishers are facing - high latency, unfair
  auction mechanics, long development time, and confusing line item
  and targeting setup.

- Plugging in prebid.js is easy. Adding new header bidding partners is
  a matter of adding tag IDs to your JSON config.
