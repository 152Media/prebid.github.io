# Getting Started

> Implementing header bidding requires close collaboration between dev and adops. 

#### From start to finish:

1. Developer downloads an example Prebid.js implementation page at [Develoepr Code Examples](/dev-docs/examples/basic-example.html). 

2. Adops follow the steps at [Adops Getting Started Guide](/adops.html). Create the bare minimum line items and creatives for developers to test with.

3. Developer starts implementing the Prebid framework to the site properties. 

4. Adops creates production ready line items and creatives in the ad server.

5. Developer tests and launches prebid to production.

#### To get started:

- If you are a developer, come to the [Develoepr Getting Started Guide](/dev-docs/getting-started.html).

- If you are in adops, come to the [Adops Getting Started Guide](/adops.html).
