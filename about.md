### Who is behind it?

Prebid.js was created in early 2015 by Matt Kendall and Paul Yang from AppNexus, together with the help of Nick Jacob from the publisher Aplus. Today, prebid.js has become a community owned project with many publishers and bidders contributing.

<br>

### Why did we create Prebid.js?

Publishers had been solving the same problems when implementing header bidding. If improperly implemented, header bidding can increase latency and cause conflicts between multiple demand partners, leading to poor user experience. These problems had made our demand integration with publishers difficult. To make it easier, we teamed up with some of the most tech savvy publishers and created the prebid.js web framework.

<br>

### Why open source?

Header bidding empowers publishers to run unbiased auctions across demand sources, thereby increasing competition and bid density. It is to both publishers and demand partnersâ€™ best interest to keep header bidding an open, unbiased ecosystem. Any company attempting to own the header bidding tech is incentivized to prioritize its own demand for the higher margin. By keeping the code open source and community owned, we ensure the header bidding auction logic is unbiased. 

Many publishers and demand partners have now joined this effort to keep the header bidding tech open and unbiased. The below contributing demand partners will maintain their integrations with prebid.js: Yieldbot, AppNexus, AOL, OpenX, Sovrn. More are joining.
