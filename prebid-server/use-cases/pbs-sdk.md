# Use Case: Prebid Server | Prebid Mobile SDK

Unlike Prebid.js, the [Prebid Mobile SDK](/prebid-mobile/prebid-mobile.html) doesn't make requests to demand sources directly. Instead, it relies entirely on Prebid Server to handle the bidder communication.

![Prebid SDK Architecture](/assets/images/prebid-server/pbs-sdk-architecture.png){:class="pb-xlg-img"}

1. The mobile app calls SDK with one or more “stored request” IDs. SDK forms OpenRTB for the auction and calls Prebid Server. This request contains one or more “stored request IDs” mapping adunits to bidders and parameters. 
1. Prebid Server looks up the stored request to find which bidders and parameters to use.
1. The auction takes place and bid responses are placed in a cache
1. Prebid Server responds to the SDK with results and ad server targeting variables
1. The ad server targeting variables are sent along with the ad request
1. When header bidding wins in the ad server, the ad server responds with a call to the Prebid Universal Creative
1. The Prebid Universal Creative pulls the winning bid from the Prebid Cache
1. And displays it

## How It Works - Detailed

### The SDK creates the OpenRTB

The iOS and Android SDKs have functions which supply:

- Which Prebid Server to use
- The account ID for that Prebid Server (obtain this from the Prebid Server host company)
- Ad unit information with a "stored request ID" (obtain these from the host company too)
- First party data
- Privacy information (e.g. a consent string)

The SDK takes information from these functions and builds out the
OpenRTB, sending it to the named Prebid Server. For example, if the
mobile app has this code:

```
// get this ID from your Prebid Server host provider
PrebidMobile.setPrebidServerAccountId("1234");
...
// get PREBID_SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ID from your Prebid Server host provider
BannerAdUnit bannerAdUnit = new BannerAdUnit("PREBID_SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ID", 300, 250);
```

The resulting OpenRTB generated by the SDK and sent to Prebid Server would be:

```
{
  "id": "random-uuid",
  "app": {
        "bundle": "AppNexus.PrebidMobileDemo",
        "ext": {
            "prebid": {
                "version": "0.2.0",
                "source": "prebid-mobile"
            }
        },
        "publisher": {
            "id": "1234" // from PrebidMobile.setPrebidServerAccountId("1234");
        },
        "ver": "1.0"
  },
  "imp": [
    {
      "id": "random-uuid",
      "banner": {
         "format": [
            {
                "h": 250,
                "w": 300
            }
        ]
      },
      "ext": {
        "prebid": {
          "storedrequest": {     // this pulls in the bidders and params for the first ad slot
            "id": "PREBID_SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ID"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "ext": {
    "prebid": {
	"storedrequest": {   // this maps to the "top-level" stored request
          "id": "1234"  // from setPrebidServerAccountId(). Pulls in global behavior (cache, targeting)
	}
    }
  }
}
```

Of course if there are multiple adunits on your app's page, there can
be multiple calls to `BannerAdUnit()` which would generate multiple `imp` objects in the OpenRTB request.

### Prebid Server Gets the Request

The request that comes in from the SDK is more like a skeleton request. There are a number of key components missing, like which bidders should
be called.

#### Prebid Server Resolves the Stored Request IDs

The example above lists two `stored request IDs`: the "top-level" ID (1234) and one "adunit-level" ID (PREBID_SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ID).

When Prebid Server sees a `stored request ID`, it queries a database to pull in the actual contents to be included in the auction. 

To continue the example, stored request ID 1234 defines the overall
request currency, caching instructions, a custom price granularity, and instructions to include ad server targeting keys for all bidders:
```
{
    "cur": [
        "EUR"
    ],
    "ext": {
        "prebid": {
            "cache": {
                "bids": {}
            },
            "targeting": {
                "includewinners": true,
                "includebidderkeys": true,
                "mediatypepricegranularity": {
                    "banner": {
                        "ranges": [
                            {
                                "max": 5,
                                "min": 0,
                                "increment": 0.01
                            },
                            {
                                "max": 8,
                                "min": 5,
                                "increment": 0.1
                            },
                            {
                                "max": 30,
                                "min": 8,
                                "increment": 1
                            }
                        ],
                        "precision": 2
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The PREBID_SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ID would have the list of bidders and params relevant for that ad unit:
```
{
    "ext": {
        "bidderA": {
            "placementId": "1111"
        },
        "bidderB": {
            "key1": "val1"
        }
    }
}
```

The power of this approach is that a number of important header bidding
 parameters can change without having to change application code!

#### Auction and Response

From here on out, the header bidding auction is the same as it is for Prebid.js:

1. Enforce privacy regulations
1. Call the bidders
1. Collect responses
1. Prepare the OpenRTB response

### The SDK Gets the Response

The response from Prebid Server is OpenRTB with some extensions like
the ad server targeting. For example, it might look like:

```
{
  "seatbid": [{
    "seat": "bidderA",
    "bid": [{
      ...
      "ext": {
        "prebid": {
          "targeting": {
            // standard Prebid ad server targeting key/values
            "hb_env": "mobile-app",
            "hb_pb": "1.20",
            "hb_size": "300x50",
            "hb_bidder": "bidderA",
            // the body of the creative will be retrieved from cache
            // if it wins
            "hb_cache_id": "20d2e558-67b0-4a43-99ba-f23e3383932e",
            "hb_cache_host": "prebid-server.example.com",
            "hb_cache_path": "/cache",
            ...
          }
        }
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Application code calls the Ad Server

The application code is responsible for calling the ad server, so it
retrieves the targeting from Prebid SDK and forwards it along with
other values.

### Display

When a Prebid ad wins in the ad server, a javascript creative is returned to the
mobile app where it runs in a web view. The javascript loads the Prebid Universal Creative code, which sees the `hb_env=mobile-app` key value pair and
realizes its time to load the creative body from the cache parameters: `hb_cache_id`, `hb_cache_host`, and `hb_cache_path`. (Or hb_cache_id_bidderA, hb_cache_host_bidderA, and hb_cache_path_bidderA when in send-all-bids mode.)

When response is received from the Prebid Cache server, it's written
into an iframe for display.
